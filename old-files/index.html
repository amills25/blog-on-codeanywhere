            <p>Week One has been similar to what I expected it would be to this point. I anticipated that this class
                would be a lot to take in,
                given I hadn't done any programming in 10 years coming into this, and it has certainly not disappointed
                in that regard. I am thankful
                that my time at my previous full-time position has already ended so that I am able to focus all of my
                attention onto the bootcamp.</p>

            <p>Throughout the bootcamp, I am simply excited to learn, and to learn a lot. For the past 5 years, I have
                been doing something that
                doesn't fit my personality or my natural giftings. I look forward to diving into the world of
                programming and to hopefully unlock
                something inside of me that will grow, challenge, and excite me in all the right ways. Right now, the
                things that I want to learn
                most about are making aestheically pleasing UX's and design, animation, and data analysis. As I look
                forward in this field and things
                that bring me life, these are the topics that stand out the most at this time.</p>

            <p>Something to know about me is that I have spent the past five years as an insurance agent, and the past
                number of years before that
                doing volunteer ministry outreach in an environment where most people didn't look like me. Both of those
                things are generally geared
                toward extroverts, of which I am not. I have learned so much through both about working with people,
                dealing with all different types
                of cultures and personalities, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I think those skills will
                benefit me greatly both in this
                bootcamp, and moving back into the real world in a new career where I will continue to work with teams
                and clients, just in (likely) a
                less forward-facing role. I look forward to working with my classmates and instructors throughout this
                process and watching us all learn and grow together.</p>

            <p>As John Calipari always says:</p>
            <blockquote>I like my team.</blockquote>

            <p>Week two of the bootcamp has been a really exciting week that has pushed me and challenged me in a lot of
                ways. Moving from markdown
                into HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS has been a big jump, but it's cool to see the growth in myself
                and those around me as everything
                builds upon the last. While I'm learning a ton and taking in a lot of information right now, there's
                still so much I hope to learn and
                develop on as we move forward. I'm really interested in film animation and data science, and I know
                skills that deep won't be covered
                in the bootcamp, I'd like to maybe create a knowledge base to help me dive deeper into those skills. I
                want to at least learn some more
                HTML, CSS, and JS skills to create some basic animations. And while we may not learn Python and the like
                in this bootcamp, I hope to
                gain skills in creating functions and using logic and math to build out ways to solve data equations.
            </p>

            <p>My biggest struggles right now are fine tuning my HTML skills and knowing what to focus on. I need to
                improve on my ability to simply
                set up a webpage correctly in HTML and know the exact order/format of the elements and attributes to
                use. For instance, in this week's
                Build exercise, I was struggling at one point when correcting the format of the HTML when inserting a
                <code>section</code>, and I ended up making
                it an <code>article</code> before realizing that it was incorrect. Beyond that, it will be nice to have
                a larger knowledge base for coding so I
                can try to find a niche that I want to pursue. Right now, it's a lot of gathering information where I
                have none, and I don't know what
                I want to do with it, or what I should be focusing in on. I think that will improve throughout the
                course of this bootcamp, but it is a bit overwhelming right now.</p>

            <p>I enjoy solving problems, and I'm learning that programming never allows a lack of problems to be solved.
                I like to think I'm pretty good
                at utilizing my resources, and I'm thankful to have a plethora of those at my disposal right now. It's
                key to focus in on exactly what the
                root issue of a problem is; that way you're solving for the right thing, and not spraying perfume on a
                casket, so to speak. So far in this
                course, I have done a lot of Googling, which I hear is an important skill for any programmer. Beyond
                that, I am thankful to be able to have
                my classmates and instructors at my disposal in Slack that I've been able to reach out to for questions.
                I also have friends outside of this
                class who are programmers that I know I will be able to reach out to and they'll always be there for me.
                Thankfully, I haven't had any major
                issues where I've needed to reach out to those outside of this class, but it's a great resource I know I
                can carry out into my future programming career.</p>

            <p>I'm really enjoying the early bits of front-end development so far as we're now through our third week.
                We've gotten into HTML and
                CSS for a couple of weeks now, and then really dove into JavaScript over this past week. It's cool the
                way you can link the three
                of them together to create something complex and usable. I've enjoyed the CSS and design aspect of it
                more than I thought I would.
                I could spend hours on just the CSS trying to make the page and its features look nice. I'm still
                struggling with JavaScript and
                developing functions from scratch. I am a man of few words, so sometimes I struggle to give every detail
                when I write, and in
                JavaScript, you can't skip over anything or your function will fail. I can make sense of the logic, but
                I just need more practice
                in creating it all myself and figure out patterns so I can improve my code-writing skills and not skip
                anything over.</p>

            <p>When it comes to my blog, I am still using only Markdown, so I haven't yet incorporated any
                <code>objects</code>. I look forward to
                soon converting it into HTML in the very least and using objects to display photos and videos so I can
                better express myself and my work through my blog posts.</p>

            <p>I hear that week four will incorporate a lot of pseudo coding, and I am a little nervous about that. Like
                I said before, I generally
                use as few words as possible in my communication, so it's not natural for me to write pseudocode before
                I have to go write real code.
                So far, my pseudocode has been the most basic of outlines, and when I see others', I see how much room
                for improvement I have in that
                regard. That said, I think it will be a very good skill to improve upon so that I can better organize my
                code when I get into bigger
                projects. It will take discipline from me in taking the time to do good pseudocode, but it seems like
                it'll be worth it in the long run.</p>

            <p>Throughout the first four weeks of bootcamp (the Onboarding phase), I got to work from home, which has
                it's pros and cons. I absolutely
                love being able to work at my own pace and be able to step outside my own home at will when I need to
                step away from the computer
                screen. As for the bootcamp itself, I thought we were set up really well for success given the fully
                remote status. I appreciated
                the activities that were more "handholding", because where I have a lack of coding knowledge, it really
                helps me to see someone
                else's steps and follow along to create something. The videos from the instructors were really helpful
                as a whole also, because it's
                one thing to read text and try to interpret it; it's another thing to have an expert on a subject walk
                you through their thought
                process and understanding.</p>

            <p>I felt hindered coming into bootcamp by having little to no coding experience prior. Having to take in a
                lot of information from
                reading on my own, it's hard to fully grasp something when it's foreign to you. On top of that, working
                on my own didn't help. When
                I would get stuck on something, it was easy to get in my own head and feel like I'm drowning and have no
                one there to pick me up. I
                look forward to having fellow bootcampers in the room with me so we can better relate to what each is
                going through and encourage
                one another along the way.</p>

            <p>While Onboarding wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, I'm thankful to have an incredible support system
                around me to encourage me and
                to keep things in perspective. Even on the most challenging days, having a daily Stand-Up meeting with
                bootcampers helped remind me
                that I'm not alone in this. This week, we had the opportunity to attend a meetup even with current and
                former bootcampers, and it
                was nice to get to talk to some fellow bootcampers and relate to them outside of purely coding, and it
                felt good to see the positivity
                and feel the encouragement of past bootcampers. Lastly, I'm thankful for my friends and family who
                continue to push me and encourage
                me through this trying season of life in being unemployed and changing careers altogether. Regardless of
                what kind of job I end up
                with, what languanges I'll have to learn about, and what blockers I face each day, I have people in my
                life that aren't going anywhere
                that I know I can turn to be uplifted.</p>

            <p>Week 5 came in like a wrecking ball after our four weeks of virtual Onboarding. I'm starting to get a solid
                grasp of HTML, CSS, and JS functions, but this week we introduced Bootstrap and the idea of State
                Management. I like Bootstrap when I have the creative freedom to make a page the way I want, but when it
                comes to using Bootstrap to make a page match an existing design, my lack of experience with it held me back
                quite a bit. The biggest thing that held me back though, was trying to wrap my mind around State Management.
                It took me a few days to grasp what that really means and how it relates to code and that slowed me down in
                setting up this week's big project. I liked the analogy of liquid water and changing its state to a gas or
                solid while maintaining the same elements. That helped me think through our project and changing the view of
                a single-page application's attributes while keeping the same elements throughout once it clicked.</p>
    
            <p>I'm picking up on the JS basics, but there's so much more to know that I don't even know about yet; the
                unknown unknown, so to speak. Things I do know I am looking forward to learning more about objects and
                classes and how to use them in my code. We've seen them, and I see the benefit, but I don't have a lot of
                practice there yet, so I look forward to more of that. I also look forward to learning about maps and other
                methods that allow us to shorten and consolidate our code.</p>
    
            <p>It's been great being in-person compared to remote. I've learning so much more simply by collaborating and
                conversing with those around me in class. There are so many different ways to go about the same problem in
                code, so it's been fun to see that and try to understand the different methods. The best part of being
                in-person has been having the instructors here, though. It's incredibly beneficial to have folks so much
                more knowledgeable than me giving me hints or showing me what to think about or how pieces of code work
                together.</p>
    
            <p>There were times this week that I felt absolutely defeated and I had to sit back and take a deep breath and
                put everything into perspective for a minute. It's my wife that keeps me going. I've been through the
                gauntlet with jobs over the past couple of years, and she's had to continually sacrifice for me because we
                have to make changes financially. I don't want her to have to do that any longer, and I don't want to force
                her to carry the load for us to stay afloat. This bootcamp is giving me the opportunity to take stress off
                of her, and set myself and my family up for future success. I can't wait!</p>

            </div>
    
            <p>I've always struggled with being patient when I'm working on projects; I just want to dive into things and get to work. Because of 
                this, the development process of coding is a challenge for me. I was always the kid who got in trouble in math class for not showing 
                their work. And for a 10-page research paper, I may do a half-page of the most basic outline. I'm learning (the hard way, at times) 
                that coding has a development process to be followed, and it has its serious benefits. 
            </p>
    
            <p>In order to develop good code, you have to be willing to make multiple iterations. I need to be more patient with the process, taking 
                things step-by-step, embracing the brainstorming and pseudocoding, and admitting I can't just dive into a project and immediately know 
                everything and get it done and functional right away.
            </p>
    
            <p>A good developer certainly embraces the process. You have to be willing to learn, willing to adapt, willing to collaborate, and willing 
                to listen. You will have to accept the fact that things won't be perfect right away. If you're being selfish, or try to get into code 
                before you have it properly planned out, you're going to fail and you're going to end up working even more in the long run.
            </p>
    
            <p>I can't speak for all programmers, because I am hardly one myself, but I know the part of the process that I hate the most is pseudocode. 
                I rarely am able to get past my first iteration of pseudocoding because once it starts to look more like code, I'd rather just go ahead 
                and turn it into real code! Once I get more experience in coding, I may be able to better think through my process, but for now, I'll get 
                more out of practicing real code, than I would planning out pseudocode for processes I've never done before.

            <p>Computer programming is a lot more than just writing code. If you jump directly into code when presented 
                with a new project, you're likely to end up with numerous bugs and create more work for yourself. It is 
                best practice, instead, to write pseudocode before actual code. Pseudocode is merely writing out the 
                patterns, steps, and algorithms of a program in plain English.</p>

            <p>By doing this, you can logically think through your program and decide how you want to make it work, which 
                can then be translated into any coding language you want. I like to incorporate a little bit of real code 
                in mine and start translating pieces as I think them through because I know I'll have to do so eventually, 
                but for many, keeping it in plain English is most beneficial. In those cases, you could hand your 
                pseudocode to someone who doesn't know anything about programming, and they would be able to read and 
                understand what your program is going to do</p>
            
            <p>Having been recently introduced to Object Oriented Programming, I found that my pseudocode really helped me 
                more than it had in the past. When you are working with objects and classes in JavaScript, it is vitally 
                important to properly organize your thoughts and your code methods. Otherwise, you will get lost, pieces 
                won't connect, and your program will be full of bugs.</p>
            
            <p>What I didn't expect, though, was that Object Oriented Programming helped me with my pseudocode. Knowing 
                that my program needed to be properly organized to function correctly, I was better able to write pseudocode 
                knowing I had to decide in advance where pieces of code would be and how they would connect.</p>
            
            <p>This method of organization is better known as a <i>design pattern.</i></p>
    
            <p>This week in web developer bootcamp, we were introduced to design patterns for the first time. While we 
                used a couple of them, including Model-View-Controller, my preferred design pattern at this time is the 
                Composite pattern. In the composite pattern, you "compose" objects into "parent" and "child" structures 
                so you can treat each of them as one. Much like a human child inherits attributes from their parents, 
                this coding design pattern acts in a similar fashion.  Your parent component can make requests from its 
                child and it can act accordingly because it has inherited the same traits as the parent.</p>

            <p>Another way to look at this pattern is with a tree and leaves. The main object component of your program 
                is the tree and a leaf is another object that inherits the traits of the tree and can do actions at the 
                request of the tree. As a parent with multiple child objects, or a tree with multiple leaf objects, it 
                would make sense to have a method in your main component that would run on each of the children at the 
                same time to create the same effect on each of them.</p>
            
            <p>Naturally, with having dozens of design patterns available, there are good and bad times to use this 
                particular one. You would choose the composite pattern if you are using multiple objects in the same way, 
                and know you're going to have very similar code to work on each of them. Each child is going to inherit 
                attributes from the parent, therefore you are able to work similarly on each of them. I found it beneficial 
                this week when creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game to use this pattern because I created a game object as a parent, 
                and a tile object as a child. If I had decided to use 4 different objects that each work in different ways, 
                then another design method may have been a better choice, but we'll save that for another day!</p>
